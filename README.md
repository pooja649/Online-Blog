## Introduction to frappe

- Frappe, pronounced fra-pay, is a full stack, batteries-included, web framework written in Python and Javascript with MariaDB as the database. It is the framework which powers ERPNext, is pretty generic and can be used to build database driven apps.
#### Why Frappe?

The key difference in Frappe compared to other frameworks is that meta-data is also treated as data. This enables you to build front-ends very easily. We believe in a monolithic architecture, so Frappe comes with almost everything you need to build a modern web application. It has a full featured Admin UI called the Desk that handles forms, navigation, lists, menus, permissions, file attachment and much more out of the box.

 Date: 7-Feb-2022  
 ## Creating Site and App & run on local server in Frappe
 
 - Open the Terminal and start bench.
 - In Second Terminal, create App by using bench new-app library_management inside Frappe-bench Directory.
 - By using bench new-site library.test, create site inside Frappe-bench Directory.
 - Run Site on Localhost by using library.test custom port name.

## Introduction to Docker, Virtual Machine and ERPNext

**What is Docker?**
<p align="justify">Docker is popular virtualization software that helps its users in developing, deploying, monitoring, and running applications in a Docker Container with all their dependencies (frameworks, libraries, etc.) to run an application in an efficient and bug-free manner.Docker Containers are Light-weight, Applications run in isolation,Occupies less space, Easily portable and highly secure, Short boot-up
time.</p>
- It can run multiple containers on a system.
- It can start multiple containers at a time on the Docker engine.
<br>

**What is Virtual Machine?**
<p align="justify">A Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps. One or more virtual “guest” machines run on a physical “host” machine.  Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and functions separately from the other VMs, even when they are all running on the same host. This means that, for example, a virtual MacOS virtual machine can run on a physical PC.</p>
- It can start only a single VM on a VMX.
- It can run only a limited number of VMs on a system.
<br>

**What is ERPNext?**

## Docker Vs Virtual Machine
- Docker is popular virtualization software that helps its users in developing, deploying, monitoring, and running applications in a Docker Container with all their dependencies. Docker containers include all dependencies (frameworks, libraries, etc.) to run an application in an efficient and bug-free manner.
- A virtual machine (VM) is a computing environment or software that aids developers to access an operating system via a physical machine.


<br>

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
**Date : 19-Feb-2022** 
## Use cases of Docker
1. Early application development
  - By creating Docker container images for the app and executing them with Docker or another runtime, developers can test the app from a local development
    PC without execution on the host OS.
2. Multi-cloud or hybrid cloud applications
  - Docker containers are portable, which means they can move easily from one server or cloud environment to another with minimal configuration changes 
    required.
3. Cost control
  - The efficiency of Docker containers relative to VMs makes Docker a handy option for teams that want to reduce how much they spend on infrastructure. By 
    taking applications running in VMs and redeploying them with Docker, organizations will likely reduce their total resource consumption.
