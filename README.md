## Introduction to frappe

- Frappe, pronounced fra-pay, is a full stack, batteries-included, web framework written in Python and Javascript with MariaDB as the database. It is the framework which powers ERPNext, is pretty generic and can be used to build database driven apps.
#### Why Frappe?

The key difference in Frappe compared to other frameworks is that meta-data is also treated as data. This enables you to build front-ends very easily. We believe in a monolithic architecture, so Frappe comes with almost everything you need to build a modern web application. It has a full featured Admin UI called the Desk that handles forms, navigation, lists, menus, permissions, file attachment and much more out of the box.

 ## Creating Site and App & run on local server in Frappe
 
 - Open the Terminal and start bench.
 - In Second Terminal, create App by using bench new-app library_management inside Frappe-bench Directory.
 - By using bench new-site library.test, create site inside Frappe-bench Directory.

## Introduction to Docker, Virtual Machine and ERPNext

**What is Docker?**
<p align="justify">Docker is popular virtualization software that helps its users in developing, deploying, monitoring, and running applications in a Docker Container with all their dependencies (frameworks, libraries, etc.) to run an application in an efficient and bug-free manner.Docker Containers are Light-weight, Applications run in isolation,Occupies less space, Easily portable and highly secure, Short boot-up
time.</p>
- It can run multiple containers on a system.
- It can start multiple containers at a time on the Docker engine.
<br>

**What is Virtual Machine?**
<p align="justify">A Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps. One or more virtual “guest” machines run on a physical “host” machine.  Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and functions separately from the other VMs, even when they are all running on the same host. This means that, for example, a virtual MacOS virtual machine can run on a physical PC.</p>
- It can start only a single VM on a VMX.
- It can run only a limited number of VMs on a system.
<br>

**What is ERPNext?**
<p align="justify">ERPNext is a full-featured business management solution that helps SMEs to record all their business transactions in a single system. With ERPNext, SMEs can make informed, fact-based, timely decisions to remain ahead in the competition.

## Docker Vs Virtual Machine
- Docker is popular virtualization software that helps its users in developing, deploying, monitoring, and running applications in a Docker Container with all their dependencies. Docker containers include all dependencies (frameworks, libraries, etc.) to run an application in an efficient and bug-free manner.
- A virtual machine (VM) is a computing environment or software that aids developers to access an operating system via a physical machine.


<br>

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
**Date : 19-Feb-2022** 
## Use cases of Docker
1. Early application development
  - By creating Docker container images for the app and executing them with Docker or another runtime, developers can test the app from a local development
    PC without execution on the host OS.
2. Multi-cloud or hybrid cloud applications
  - Docker containers are portable, which means they can move easily from one server or cloud environment to another with minimal configuration changes 
    required.
3. Cost control
  - The efficiency of Docker containers relative to VMs makes Docker a handy option for teams that want to reduce how much they spend on infrastructure. By 
    taking applications running in VMs and redeploying them with Docker, organizations will likely reduce their total resource consumption.

<h3 align='center'>Making new specification and Flow for Noticeboard App</h3>

- Notice will be created by CLERK then it will be in draft state.
- CLERK and HOD can create notice no one else from other department able to create notice for their department.
- Another requirement when notice is created by clerk It will be in Draft state when Hod Submit Notice only then it would be published.
- Naming Series of notice maintained department wise eg: Notice-CSE/2022/00001, Notice-CIVIL/2022/00001.
- If HOD Cancel the notice then Clerk is able to make changes then again send it to HOD.  
<br>

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
**Date : 25-Apr-2022**
<h3 align='center'>Creating doctype in Existing Noticeboard App</h3>

- In First approach we decide to use create doctype and apply workflow on it.
- Where all states are defined like Approve by hod, Draft etc.
- We allote Department to their Respective Hod and Clerk  So that they are able to create notice.
- Every thing Works fine but When we apply some code then workflow states create problem. eg data is saved but changes apply with delay.
- We find workflow also make task for app difficult because its file is not created inside the app that why it portability is difficult.
- So we decide to work without workflow also learn new things from mistakes.   
<br>

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
**Date : 26-Apr-2022**
<h3 align='center'>Naming Series as Department wise</h3>

- Assigning department to Hod & Clerk to one department in User Permission List.
- We use condition like cse = department_name.
- Department_name is fetched from doctype use function self.fieldname.
- After apply such condition we use make_autoname function.
- self.name = make_autoname('NOTICE-'+'CSE'+'/'+'.YYYY.'+'/'+'.#####')
- This function return series 'NOTICE-CSE/2022/00001'
<br>

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
**Date : 27-Apr-2022**
<h3 align='center'>Fetching HOD by using variables in query</h3>

- First we use Simple Frappe query "frappe.db.get_value('User', 'hodcse@gmail.com', 'full_name')".
- But this depends upon the email of hod if email will change in future then we need to change it.
- Also we have to wrote this many times.
- So we use another optimized version of query.
<br>

```py
department = self.department
requiredRole = "Hod" 
		
		self.hod = frappe.db.sql(f""" select full_name 
			from `tabUser` 
			where `email` IN (select user 
			from `tabUser Permission` 
			where `for_value`="{department}" AND `user` IN (select parent 
			from `tabHas Role` 
			where `role`="{requiredRole}" )) """)
```

- By using this query with variable we are able to use this for all departments.
<br>

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
**Date : 28-Apr-2022**
<h3 align='center'>New Fee requirent</h3>

- First we Create Fee Categories Like Development Fee, Tutuion Fee, Transportation fee.

- Like If a Student has one sibling than Tution fees would be 50% discount, If there are two Siblings than Tution Fee would be 25%.
- Transportation Fee depends on various routes eg Bus Fee for Route1 : 500/- than Fee for Route2 : 400/-.
<br>

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
**Date : 29-Apr-2022**
<h3 align='center'>Implementing Fee on local server</h3>

- First we import data like Program, student, courses.
- Creating Fee category as per requirement Development Fee, Tution Fee, Transporatation Fee.
- Finding a way how to link siblings of same school using minimal customization.
- We set up students who have siblings but when we select option siblings studying in the same school then we are able to select students from available students but the program is not fetched.
- Along with this We find the received income cost center is also set in schedule. We can find all the income in the Fee cost center.

<h3 align='center'>Try to optimize Notice.py Code</h3>

<br>

```py
department=self.department
abbr=frappe.db.get_value( 'Department' , department ,'department_abbreviation' )
self.name=make_autoname( 'NOTICE-' + abbr + '/' + '.YYYY.' + '/' + '.#####' )
```
